# LIBFRED

`libfred` is a library implementing basic operations (create/update/delete/info etc.) on FRED registry core objects (registrar, domain, contact, nsset, keyset and related).


## Versioning

Use semantic versioning `major.minor.patch` and bump:
  * `major` version when you make incompatible API changes,
  * `minor` version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
  * `patch` version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

For pre-releases use `-rcX` suffix (`major.minor.patch-rcX`) where `X` starts at `1` and consecutively increments.
